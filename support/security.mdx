## Security compliance

Logo.dev currently does not have SOC 2 or other formal security certifications. However, we are actively working towards achieving these certifications and maintain enterprise-grade security practices:

- Regular security audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Enterprise flat file delivery

For organizations requiring enhanced security controls, we offer **flat file delivery**:

- You provide the specific logo data you need
- We deliver it via secure flat file transfer at regular intervals
- Complete control over data flow and security
- No API integration required

<Tip>
  Flat file delivery is ideal for enterprises with strict security requirements
  or air-gapped environments. Contact team@logo.dev to discuss your needs.
