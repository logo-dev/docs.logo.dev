### How to use stock ticker logos

Using the stock ticker logo API is very simple, all you need is your publishable key from the [Logo.dev dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard).

<Frame caption="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/etsy?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY">
  <img
    alt="Etsy Logo"
    width="100"
    height="100"
    src="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/etsy?token=live_6a1a28fd-6420-4492-aeb0-b297461d9de2&size=200"
  />
</Frame>

Here's an example of how to implement a stock ticker logo look up for Etsy on your website:

<CodeGroup>

```html Example
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/etsy?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" alt="Etsy stock ticker logo" />
```


```html Format
<img
  src="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/:symbol?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  alt="Stock ticker logo"
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

Anywhere you can use an image URL, such as Excel, Slack, or email, you can use this endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```html Example
https://img.logo.dev/ticker/etsy?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```


```html Format
https://img.logo.dev/ticker/:symbol?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

</CodeGroup>

### How stock ticker look up works

For supported exchanges, ticker symbols are mapped to domain names. So whether you do a look up by ticker symbol or domain name, you'll get the same result.

### Exchange support

We support ticker symbols from all major global exchanges. By default, if you don't specify an exchange, we'll search American markets (NYSE and NASDAQ).

To specify a particular exchange, append the exchange shortcode after the ticker symbol with a dot:

<CodeGroup>

```html American markets (default)
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/AAPL?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" alt="Apple stock ticker logo" />
```


```html London Stock Exchange
<img
  src="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/AAPL.LSE?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  alt="Apple logo from London Stock Exchange"
/>
```


```html Tokyo Stock Exchange
<img
  src="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/7203.JPX?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  alt="Toyota stock ticker logo from Tokyo Stock Exchange"
/>
```

</CodeGroup>
