Our stock ticker logo API provides a quick and efficient way to add company logos to your financial website or application.

It's another way to use our logo API, using stock ticker symbols from supported exchanges.

### How to use stock ticker logos

Using the stock ticker logo API is very simple, all you need is your public token from the [Logo.dev dashboard](https://logo.dev/dashboard).

<Frame caption="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/etsy?token=:public_token">
  <img
    alt="Etsy Logo"
    width="100"
    height="100"
    src="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/etsy?token=live_6a1a28fd-6420-4492-aeb0-b297461d9de2&size=200"
  />
</Frame>

Here's an example of how to implement a stock ticker logo look up for Etsy on your website:

<CodeGroup>
```html Example
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/etsy?token=:public_token" />
```

```html Format
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/ticker/:symbol?token=:public_token" />
```

</CodeGroup>

Anywhere you can use an image URL, such as Excel, Slack, or email, you can use this endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```html Example
https://img.logo.dev/ticker/etsy?token=:public_token
```

```html Format
https://img.logo.dev/ticker/:symbol?token=:public_token
```

</CodeGroup>

### How stock ticker look up works

For supported exchanges, ticker symbols are mapped to domain names. So whether you do a look up by ticker symbol or domain name, you'll get the same result.

### Supported exchanges

Logo images by ticker symbol are currently supported for:

- NYSE
