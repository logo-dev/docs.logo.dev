### How to use ISIN logos

Using the ISIN logo API is very simple, all you need is your publishable key from the [Logo.dev dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard).

<Frame caption="https://img.logo.dev/isin/US0378331005?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY">
  <img
    alt="Apple Logo"
    width="100"
    height="100"
    src="https://img.logo.dev/isin/US0378331005?token=live_6a1a28fd-6420-4492-aeb0-b297461d9de2&size=200"
  />
</Frame>

Here's an example of how to implement an ISIN logo lookup for Apple on your website:

<CodeGroup>
```html Example
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/isin/US0378331005?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" alt="Apple ISIN logo" />
```

```html Format
<img
  src="https://img.logo.dev/isin/:isin?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  alt="ISIN logo"
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

Anywhere you can use an image URL, such as Excel, Slack, or email, you can use this endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```html Example
https://img.logo.dev/isin/US0378331005?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

```html Format
https://img.logo.dev/isin/:isin?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

</CodeGroup>

### How ISIN lookup works

We map ISIN codes to their corresponding company domains to retrieve the correct logo. This ensures you get the official brand asset for the security's underlying company.

### Supported ISINs

We support valid ISIN codes from all major global markets. The 12-character alphanumeric code typically consists of:

- A two-letter country code (e.g., US, DE, GB)
- A nine-character alphanumeric national security identifier
- A single check digit

<Note>
  If you find an ISIN that doesn't return the expected logo, please [report
  it](mailto:support@logo.dev?subject=Missing%20ISIN%20Logo) or submit an update
  via the dashboard.
