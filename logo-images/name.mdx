Get brand logos when you only have a brand name, not a domain.

Perfect for customer lists, spreadsheets, or user input where domains aren't available.

### How to use name logos

Access any brand logo by name with your publishable key from the [Logo.dev dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard).

<Frame caption="https://img.logo.dev/name/shopify?token=:publishable_key">
  <img
    alt="Shopify Logo"
    width="100"
    height="100"
    src="https://img.logo.dev/name/shopify?token=live_6a1a28fd-6420-4492-aeb0-b297461d9de2&size=200"
  />
</Frame>

Here's how to display a brand logo by name:

<CodeGroup>
```html Example
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/name/shopify?token=:publishable_key" alt="Shopify logo" />
```

```html Format
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/name/:brand?token=:publishable_key" alt="Brand logo by name" />
```

</CodeGroup>

Use name logos anywhere you can use an image URL (spreadsheets, dashboards, or customer lists):

<CodeGroup>
```html Example
https://img.logo.dev/name/shopify?token=:publishable_key
```

```html Format
https://img.logo.dev/name/:brand?token=:publishable_key
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The name lookup API is a convenient wrapper over our [Brand Search API](/brand-search/introduction) that returns the first result (like "I'm Feeling Lucky" for brand logos). It uses the same Brand Search index to find the best match for your query.
</Note>

### URL-encode brand names

Brand names with spaces or special characters must be URL-encoded.

<CodeGroup>
```html Spaces
sweet green → sweet%20green
https://img.logo.dev/name/sweet%20green?token=:publishable_key
```

```html Special characters
AT&T → AT%26T
https://img.logo.dev/name/AT%26T?token=:publishable_key
```

```html Multiple words
The Home Depot → The%20Home%20Depot
https://img.logo.dev/name/The%20Home%20Depot?token=:publishable_key
```

</CodeGroup>

In JavaScript, use `encodeURIComponent()` to handle encoding automatically:

```javascript
const brandName = "sweet green";
const encodedName = encodeURIComponent(brandName);
const logoUrl = `https://img.logo.dev/name/${encodedName}?token=${apiKey}`;
```

### Parameters

The name endpoint supports all the same parameters as the [standard logo endpoint](/logo-images/get):

- `size` - Resize logos (default: 128px)
- `format` - Choose png, jpg, or webp
- `theme` - Optimize for light or dark backgrounds
- `greyscale` - Convert to greyscale
- `fallback` - Control fallback behavior

<CodeGroup>
```html Custom size
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/name/shopify?token=:publishable_key&size=256" />
```

```html PNG format
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/name/shopify?token=:publishable_key&format=png" />
```

```html Dark theme
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/name/shopify?token=:publishable_key&theme=dark&format=png" />
```

</CodeGroup>

### How name lookup works

When you request a logo by name, we:

1. Search our Brand Search index for the best match
2. Return the logo for the top result's domain
3. Apply any parameters (size, format, etc.)

This is equivalent to calling the Brand Search API and using the first result's domain with the logo endpoint.

### FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When should I use name lookup vs domain lookup?">
    Use name lookup when you only have brand names (customer lists, user input, spreadsheets). Use domain lookup when you have verified domains. Domain lookup is faster and more accurate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the name doesn't match any brand?">
    We return a generated monogram fallback, just like the standard logo endpoint. Use `fallback=404` to get a 404 response instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How accurate is the name matching?">
    Name lookup uses the same Brand Search index that powers our search API. It returns the most popular match for your query. For ambiguous names, use the [Brand Search API](/brand-search/introduction) to see all matches and choose the right one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I customize the logo appearance?">
    Yes. All parameters from the [logo endpoint](/logo-images/get) work with name lookup (size, format, theme, greyscale, and more).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to URL-encode single-word names?">
    No. Single words without special characters don't need encoding. It's safe to always encode though. `encodeURIComponent("shopify")` still returns `"shopify"`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I find a wrong match?">
    Report issues at [logo.dev/update](https://www.logo.dev/update) or from the dashboard. We continuously improve our Brand Search index based on feedback.
