### How to use crypto logos

Access any cryptocurrency logo with your publishable key from the [Logo.dev dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard).

<Frame caption="https://img.logo.dev/crypto/eth?token=:publishable_key">
  <img
    alt="Ethereum Logo"
    width="100"
    height="100"
    src="https://img.logo.dev/crypto/eth?token=live_6a1a28fd-6420-4492-aeb0-b297461d9de2&size=200"
  />
</Frame>

Here's how to display Ethereum's logo on your website:

<CodeGroup>
```html Example
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/crypto/eth?token=:publishable_key" alt="Ethereum cryptocurrency logo" />
```

```html Format
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/crypto/:symbol?token=:publishable_key" alt="Cryptocurrency logo" />
```

</CodeGroup>

Use crypto logos anywhere you can use an image URL—trading platforms, portfolio apps, or price trackers:

<CodeGroup>
```html Example
https://img.logo.dev/crypto/btc?token=:publishable_key
```

```html Format
https://img.logo.dev/crypto/:symbol?token=:publishable_key
```

</CodeGroup>
