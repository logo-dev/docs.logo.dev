Your company logo appears in more places than just your website. Search engines, email clients, and brand databases all display logos to help users identify businesses. This section covers how to get your logo appearing correctly across these platforms.

## Where your logo can appear

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Google Search Results" icon="magnifying-glass" href="/brand-visibility/google-favicon">
    Display your favicon next to your website in Google Search results
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email Inboxes" icon="envelope" href="/brand-visibility/email-logos">
    Show your logo in Gmail, Apple Mail, Yahoo, and Outlook
  </Card>
  <Card title="Logo.dev Database" icon="database" href="/brand-visibility/logo-dev-database">
    Get your logo included in Logo.dev for apps and websites that use our API
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why this matters

When your logo appears consistently across platforms:

- **Recognition**: Users identify your brand faster in crowded inboxes and search results
- **Trust**: Verified logos signal legitimacy and reduce phishing concerns
- **Engagement**: Studies show branded emails have higher open rates

## Quick reference

| Platform | Method | Time to appear | Cost |
|----------|--------|----------------|------|
| Google Search | Favicon on your website | Days to weeks | Free |
| Gmail | BIMI with certificate | 1-2 weeks after setup | $1,000-1,500/year (certificate) |
| Apple Mail | Apple Business Connect | Up to 7 business days | Free |
| Yahoo Mail | BIMI with certificate | 1-2 weeks after setup | $1,000-1,500/year (certificate) |
| Outlook | Profile picture only | Immediate | Free |
| Logo.dev | Submit request | Within 24 hours | Free |

<Note>
  BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) is the most comprehensive solution for email logos, but requires email authentication setup and a certificate. Apple Business Connect is free but only works in Apple Mail.
