Displaying your company logo in email inboxes helps recipients recognize your brand before opening messages. This guide covers every method for getting your logo to appear in Gmail, Apple Mail, Yahoo, Outlook, and other email clients.

## Choose your approach

| Method | Works in | Cost | Requirements |
|--------|----------|------|--------------|
| [BIMI](#bimi) | Gmail, Yahoo, Apple Mail, Fastmail | $1,000-1,500/year | DMARC, certificate |
| [Apple Branded Mail](#apple-branded-mail) | Apple Mail only | Free | DMARC, Apple Business Connect |
| [Provider profiles](#provider-profile-pictures) | Varies by provider | Free | Account with each provider |
| [Gravatar](#gravatar) | Thunderbird, Airmail, Postbox | Free | Gravatar account |

<Note>
  BIMI is the most comprehensive solution, working across multiple major email providers with a single setup. Apple Branded Mail is free but limited to Apple Mail users.
</Note>

## BIMI

Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) is an email standard that displays your verified logo across supporting email clients including Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Apple Mail (iOS 16+), and Fastmail.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up BIMI, you need:

1. **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** configured for your domain
2. **DMARC policy** set to `quarantine` or `reject` with `pct=100`
3. **A square logo** in SVG Tiny 1.2 P/S format
4. **A certificate** (VMC or CMC) from an authorized issuer

### Step 1: Configure email authentication

Your domain must have proper email authentication in place. Check your current DMARC policy:

```bash
dig TXT _dmarc.yourdomain.com
```

Your DMARC record must include:
- `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` (not `p=none`)
- `pct=100` (applies to all messages)

Example DMARC record for BIMI:

```txt
v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

<Warning>
  Don't set your DMARC policy to `reject` until you've verified all legitimate email sources are properly authenticated. Misconfigured DMARC can cause your emails to be rejected.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Prepare your logo

BIMI requires your logo in a specific format:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Format | SVG Tiny 1.2 P/S |
| Dimensions | Square (1:1 aspect ratio) |
| Minimum size | 96x96 pixels (for Gmail) |
| Background | Solid color (no transparency) |
| File size | Under 32KB recommended |

The SVG Tiny P/S format has specific requirements. Use a [BIMI logo generator tool](https://bimigroup.org/bimi-generator/) to convert your logo to the correct format.

### Step 3: Obtain a certificate

BIMI requires third-party verification through either:

**Verified Mark Certificate (VMC)**: Requires a registered trademark. Costs approximately $1,000-1,500/year. Issuers include DigiCert and Entrust.

**Common Mark Certificate (CMC)**: For logos without trademarks. Lower cost but fewer email providers support it. Gmail requires VMC.

### Step 4: Host your BIMI files

Upload your logo and certificate to a publicly accessible HTTPS URL:

```
https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/bimi/logo.svg
https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/bimi/certificate.pem
```

### Step 5: Add the BIMI DNS record

Create a TXT record at `default._bimi.yourdomain.com`:

```txt
v=BIMI1; l=https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/bimi/logo.svg; a=https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/bimi/certificate.pem
```

If you don't have a certificate yet, you can omit the `a=` parameter, but most email providers won't display your logo.

### BIMI support by provider

| Provider | VMC Required | CMC Supported | Notes |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Gmail | Yes | No | Displays in mobile app and opened emails |
| Yahoo Mail | Yes | Yes | Full inbox support |
| Apple Mail | No | Yes | iOS 16+, macOS Ventura+ |
| Fastmail | No | Yes | Full support |

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I add my logo to Apple Mail?">
  You have two options:
  1. **Apple Branded Mail** (free): Set up through Apple Business Connect. Requires DMARC authentication and Apple's approval. Works only in Apple Mail.
  2. **BIMI** (paid): Set up BIMI with a certificate. Works in Apple Mail (iOS 16+) and other providers like Gmail and Yahoo.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I add my logo to Gmail?">
  Gmail requires BIMI with a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC). You'll need:
  1. DMARC at enforcement level (`p=quarantine` or `p=reject`)
  2. A trademarked logo
  3. A VMC from DigiCert or Entrust ($1,000-1,500/year)
  4. Your logo in SVG Tiny P/S format

  Gmail profile pictures only work when sending from Gmail/Google Workspace accounts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Outlook support BIMI?">
  No. Microsoft has not announced support for BIMI in Outlook or Microsoft 365. The only way to display a logo in Outlook is through your Microsoft account profile picture, which only works when sending from Outlook/Microsoft accounts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get my logo in email without BIMI?">
  For Apple Mail, yes. Use Apple Branded Mail through Apple Business Connect, which is free and doesn't require a certificate. For Gmail and Yahoo, BIMI with a certificate is currently the only option for displaying verified logos.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does BIMI take to start working?">
  After completing setup:
  - DNS propagation: 24-48 hours
  - Email provider processing: 1-2 weeks
  - Full rollout can take several weeks depending on the provider
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need a trademark for BIMI?">
  For Gmail, yes. Gmail requires a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC), which requires a registered trademark. Yahoo and Apple Mail accept Common Mark Certificates (CMC), which don't require trademarks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between BIMI and Apple Branded Mail?">
  **BIMI** is an open standard that works across multiple email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Apple Mail, Fastmail). It requires a certificate ($1,000-1,500/year for VMC).

  **Apple Branded Mail** is Apple's proprietary system that only works in Apple Mail. It's free but limited to Apple devices.

  If budget allows, implement both for maximum coverage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why isn't my logo showing after BIMI setup?">
  Common issues:
  - **DMARC not enforced**: Must be `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` with `pct=100`
  - **Certificate not valid**: Verify your VMC/CMC is properly issued and accessible
  - **Logo format incorrect**: Must be SVG Tiny 1.2 P/S format
  - **DNS not propagated**: Wait 24-48 hours for DNS changes
  - **Provider delay**: Some providers take weeks to start displaying logos
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does email logo display affect deliverability?">
  The logo itself doesn't affect deliverability, but the required email authentication (DMARC, SPF, DKIM) significantly improves deliverability and reduces spam filtering.
