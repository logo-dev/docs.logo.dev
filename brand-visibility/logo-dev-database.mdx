Logo.dev serves millions of company logos to apps, websites, CRMs, and business tools worldwide. If your company's logo is missing, incorrect, or outdated, you can submit a request to add or update it.

## Submit your logo

To add or update your company logo in the Logo.dev database:

1. Go to [logo.dev/update](https://www.logo.dev/update)
2. Enter your company domain
3. Upload your logo or describe the issue
4. Submit the request

Our team reviews submissions and updates the database within 24 hours for most requests.

<Note>
  You must have authority to represent the brand. We verify submissions to prevent unauthorized logo changes.
</Note>

## Logo requirements

For best results, submit logos that meet these specifications:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Format | PNG or SVG preferred |
| Background | Transparent |
| Dimensions | At least 512x512 pixels |
| Quality | High resolution, not pixelated |
| Content | Primary logo mark (not wordmark-only if avoidable) |

## What gets included

When your logo is added to Logo.dev, it becomes available through:

- **Logo Images API**: Apps can fetch your logo by domain
- **Brand Search**: Your company appears in brand name searches
- **Describe API**: Extended brand data for paid API users

Logos are served globally through our CDN, meaning any app using Logo.dev will display your updated logo automatically.
