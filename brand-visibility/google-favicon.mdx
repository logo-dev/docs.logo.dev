Google displays website favicons next to search results to help users identify brands. This guide covers how to set up your favicon so it appears in Google Search.

## Requirements

Before Google will display your favicon, ensure you meet these requirements:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Dimensions | Square, minimum 8x8 pixels (48x48+ recommended) |
| Format | ICO, PNG, SVG, or any valid favicon format |
| Aspect ratio | Must be 1:1 (square) |
| Accessibility | Googlebot must be able to crawl your favicon |
| Content | No inappropriate imagery (hate symbols, adult content) |

<Note>
  Google recommends favicons of 48x48 pixels or larger for best display quality across devices.
</Note>

## Add the favicon to your website

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your favicon file">
    Design a square image that represents your brand. Save it in a web-compatible format (PNG or ICO are most common).

    ```
    favicon.ico (32x32 or 48x48 pixels)
    ```

    For high-DPI displays, consider creating multiple sizes or using SVG format.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the link tag to your homepage">
    Add a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of your homepage HTML:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```html Standard favicon
    <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico">
    ```

    ```html PNG favicon
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon.png">
    ```

    ```html SVG favicon
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg">
    ```

    ```html Multiple sizes
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Google looks at your homepage to find the favicon for your entire site.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify crawlability">
    Ensure your `robots.txt` file doesn't block access to your favicon:

    ```txt robots.txt
    # Allow favicon access
    User-agent: Googlebot
    Allow: /favicon.ico

    User-agent: Googlebot-Image
    Allow: /favicon.ico
    ```

    Both `Googlebot` and `Googlebot-Image` must be able to access your favicon file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request indexing (optional)">
    Speed up the process by requesting Google re-crawl your homepage:

    1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
    2. Enter your homepage URL in the URL Inspection tool
    3. Click "Request Indexing"

    Without this step, it can take several days to weeks for Google to discover your favicon.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important limitations

**One favicon per hostname**: Google supports one favicon per site hostname. Subdomains (like `blog.example.com`) can have different favicons than your main domain, but subdirectories (`example.com/blog/`) share the same favicon.

**No guarantee of display**: Even with correct implementation, Google doesn't guarantee your favicon will appear in search results.

**Processing time**: Changes can take days to weeks to appear, depending on how often Google crawls your site.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="My favicon isn't showing in Google Search">
  Common causes:
  - **Blocked by robots.txt**: Check that Googlebot can access your favicon URL
  - **Recently added**: Allow several days to weeks for Google to process
  - **Wrong location**: The link tag must be on your homepage, not just inner pages
  - **Content policy**: Google may reject inappropriate imagery
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use different favicons for different pages?">
  No. Google uses one favicon per hostname. All pages on `example.com` share the same favicon. Only different subdomains (like `app.example.com`) can have separate favicons.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the best favicon format?">
  ICO format has the widest compatibility. PNG works well for modern browsers. SVG scales perfectly but has slightly less browser support. For best coverage, provide ICO as a fallback with PNG or SVG as the primary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does it take for changes to appear?">
  Typically several days to a few weeks. You can speed this up by requesting indexing through Google Search Console, but there's no way to force immediate updates.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is Google showing my old favicon?">
  Google caches favicons and updates them based on crawl frequency. Request re-indexing through Search Console and wait for the cache to refresh. Avoid changing your favicon frequently.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does favicon size affect SEO?">
  Favicon size doesn't directly impact SEO rankings, but a clear, recognizable favicon can improve click-through rates by helping users identify your brand in search results.
