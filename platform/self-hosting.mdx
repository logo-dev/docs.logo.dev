<Note>
  Direct linking to Logo.dev always provides the latest logo assets.
  Self-hosting is available for Pro and Enterprise plans.
</Note>

Logo.dev's CDN delivers the freshest logos worldwide. Here's how to optimize performance while respecting plan limits.

## Why direct linking wins

Direct API calls ensure you always get:

- Latest logo versions automatically
- Optimized formats and sizes
- Global CDN performance
- Zero maintenance overhead

```javascript
// Always current, always fast
const logoUrl = `https://img.logo.dev/${domain}?token=${API_KEY}`;
```

## Caching by plan

| Plan           | Browser/CDN cache | Application cache | Self-hosting  |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| **Community**  | ✅ 24 hours       | ❌                | ❌            |
| **Startup**    | ✅ 24 hours       | ❌                | ❌            |
| **Pro**        | ✅ 24 hours       | ✅ Unlimited      | ✅            |
| **Enterprise** | ✅ 24 hours       | ✅ Unlimited      | ✅ Custom SLA |

## Browser caching (all plans)

Logo.dev handles caching headers automatically:

```http
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400
ETag: "logo-version-hash"
```

Browsers cache logos for 24 hours. Users get instant loads on repeat visits.
