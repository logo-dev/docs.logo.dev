All plans must follow these fair use guidelines. We'll reach out before taking any action.

## Examples of fair use

✅ Displaying logos in your application  
✅ Enriching customer data with logos  
✅ Building directories with company logos  
✅ Adding logos to dashboards and reports  
✅ Using logos in presentations  
✅ Email signatures with company logos

## Never fair use

❌ Creating a competing logo API  
❌ Bulk scraping logos for redistribution  
❌ Building a logo search as your primary product  
❌ Reselling Logo.dev data without transformation  
❌ Claiming ownership of accessed logos

## Usage guidelines

The best way to stay compliant is to use Logo.dev to enhance an existing product that provides value beyond just logos.

### Good examples

- **CRM systems**: Display company logos next to customer records
- **Email tools**: Auto-add recipient company logos to signatures
- **Analytics platforms**: Show logos in performance dashboards

### Bad examples

- A website that only searches and displays logos
- An API that proxies Logo.dev requests
- A logo download tool with no other functionality

## Technical limits

- **No scraping**: Don't automate bulk logo downloads
- **User-driven requests**: API calls should be triggered by user actions
- **Reasonable caching**: Follow our [caching guidelines](/platform/self-hosting)
- **Respect rate limits**: Even with caching enabled

## Attribution and licensing

- Logos remain property of their trademark owners
- Use logos to identify brands, not imply endorsement
- Free plans must include [attribution](/platform/attribution)
- Don't register trademarks on accessed logos
