<Note>
  Service is never stopped without notification. We email you before any
  enforcement.
</Note>

Logo.dev uses rate limits to ensure fair use and keep services affordable. All limits are based on monthly request counts.

## Limits by plan

| Plan       | Requests/month | Enforcement |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Free       | 500,000        | Proactive   |
| Startup    | 1,000,000      | Proactive   |
| Pro        | 5,000,000      | Soft limit  |
| Enterprise | 5,000,000+     | Soft limit  |

## Enforcing rate limits

**Proactive**: You'll receive an email when approaching your limit. Service may be shut off for clear [fair use](/platform/fair-use) violations.

**Soft limit**: If you exceed your monthly limits consistently, you'll receive a request to upgrade your account.

## What counts as a request

Each API call = one request:

- Images (`img.logo.dev`)
- Brand Search API
- Stock Ticker API
- Describe API

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if I need more requests?">
For custom limits or higher volumes, [contact us](mailto:team@logo.dev).
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens when I hit my rate limit?">
  We'll email you before taking any action. Service continues while we discuss
  options. The only exception is if you violate our [fair use
  guidelines](/platform/fair-use) after we've contacted you.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My logos aren't loading—am I being rate limited?">
  No. If logos aren't loading, it's **not** because of rate limits unless we've
  specifically emailed you. Check your API key and implementation first.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I check my current usage?">
  Yes! View your real-time usage in your
  [dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard). For Basic plans, note that limits
  may adjust based on system demands.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I just go a little over for one month?">
  It's okay to go a little bit over. As long as your project doesn't violate our
  [fair use guidelines](/platform/fair-use), we're not going to stop you
  immediately. However, it might be a good time to consider upgrading your
  account.
