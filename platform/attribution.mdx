## How attribution works

Attribution ensures proper domain verification and helps us maintain free access to Logo.dev. Your attribution link:

- Must be on your **production site** (not staging or localhost)
- Must be **publicly accessible** and viewable in browsers
- Must **pass referrer data** (remove any `noreferrer` attributes)

## Implementation

Add this link on any page displaying Logo.dev logos:

```html
<a href="https://logo.dev">Logos provided by Logo.dev</a>
```

### Example implementation

```html
<div class="customer-logos">
  <img src="https://img.logo.dev/apple.com?token=pk_xxxxxxxxxxx" alt="Apple" />
  <img
    src="https://img.logo.dev/google.com?token=pk_xxxxxxxxxxx"
    alt="Google"
  />
  <img
    src="https://img.logo.dev/microsoft.com?token=pk_xxxxxxxxxxx"
    alt="Microsoft"
  />
</div>
<p class="attribution">
  <a href="https://logo.dev">Logos provided by Logo.dev</a>
</p>
```

## Placement options

Place attribution where users can see it:

- **Near logo displays** - Directly below or beside logo grids
- **In page footer** - With other credits and links
- **On about pages** - For apps behind authentication

<Accordion title="Can I use staging domains during development?">
  Yes, but attribution must be on your production domain when you launch.
