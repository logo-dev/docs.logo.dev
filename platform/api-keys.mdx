## Key types

### Publishable key (`pk_`)

Client-side safe. Only works with `img.logo.dev` for accessing our image CDN.

```html
<img src="https://img.logo.dev/nike.com?token=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" />
```

### Secret key (`sk_`)

Server-side only. Required for all REST API endpoints. **Never expose this key.**

```javascript
// Server-side only
fetch("https://api.logo.dev/v1/search", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY`,
  },
});
```
