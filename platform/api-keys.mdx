<Note>
  View and manage your API keys in the [Logo.dev
  dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard/api-keys).
</Note>

Logo.dev provides two types of API keys. Publishable keys are automatically secured for safe client-side use, while secret keys require traditional server-side protection.

## Key types

### Publishable key (`pk_`)

Use anywhere — browsers, mobile apps, client-side code. Only works with `img.logo.dev`.

**These keys are automatically protected.** We handle security for you.

```html
<img
  src="https://img.logo.dev/nike.com?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  alt="Nike logo"
/>
```

### Secret key (`sk_`)

Server-side only. Required for search, describe, and other API endpoints. Never expose this key.

```javascript
// Server-side only
const response = await fetch("https://api.logo.dev/v1/search?query=nike", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer LOGO_DEV_SECRET_KEY`,
  },
});
```

## How we protect publishable keys

Your publishable keys are safe to use in public code because we automatically secure them for you.

**We block suspicious requests before they're processed and never bill you for blocked traffic.** Even if someone copies your publishable key, they can't rack up charges on your account.

### Automatic protections

When a request reaches our servers, we validate it against multiple signals:

- **Endpoint restriction** — Publishable keys only work with the image CDN
- **Anomaly detection** — We monitor for usage patterns that don't match your normal traffic
- **Origin blocking** — Suspicious referrers and excessive volumes are blocked before they impact your quota

## Domain restrictions

For additional control, you can restrict your publishable key to specific domains. When enabled, only requests with a matching `Referer` header will be allowed.

### How to enable

1. Go to [API Keys](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard/api-keys) in your dashboard
2. Toggle **Allowed Domains Only**
3. Add your domains, one per line
4. Click **Save Changes**

### Domain format

- `example.com` — matches only `example.com`
- `*.example.com` — matches all subdomains (e.g., `app.example.com`, `www.example.com`)

<Warning>
  **Set up referrers before enabling.** Once domain restrictions are enabled,
  requests without a `Referer` header (direct traffic) will be blocked. Make
  sure your application sends referrer data before turning this on.
</Warning>

### Ensuring your app sends referrer data

Browsers send the `Referer` header automatically for most requests, but certain configurations can prevent this. Here's how to ensure referrers are sent correctly.

#### Check your Referrer-Policy

The `Referrer-Policy` header controls what referrer information is sent with requests. These policies work with domain restrictions:

| Policy                            | Works? | Notes                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | ✅     | Modern browser default. Sends origin cross-site. |
| `origin`                          | ✅     | Always sends origin (recommended for APIs).      |
| `origin-when-cross-origin`        | ✅     | Sends origin for cross-origin requests.          |
| `unsafe-url`                      | ✅     | Sends full URL (not recommended).                |
| `no-referrer`                     | ❌     | Never sends referrer. Will break restrictions.   |
| `same-origin`                     | ❌     | Only sends for same-origin. Will break.          |

#### HTML meta tag

Add this to your `<head>` to ensure referrers are sent:

```html
<meta name="referrer" content="origin" />
```

#### Next.js configuration

Add referrer headers in `next.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/:path*",
        headers: [
          {
            key: "Referrer-Policy",
            value: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

#### Per-image referrer policy

You can also set the policy on individual images:

```html
<img
  src="https://img.logo.dev/stripe.com?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  referrerpolicy="origin"
  alt="Stripe logo"
/>
```

### Testing your setup

Before enabling domain restrictions:

1. Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab)
2. Load a page with Logo.dev images
3. Click on an `img.logo.dev` request
4. Check that the `Referer` header is present and shows your domain

If no `Referer` header appears, check your `Referrer-Policy` settings.

### What gets blocked

When domain restrictions are enabled:

- ✅ Requests from allowed domains
- ❌ Requests from unlisted domains
- ❌ Requests with no `Referer` header (direct access, some privacy tools)
- ❌ Requests from `localhost` (unless explicitly added)

<Tip>
  Add `localhost` and `*.localhost` to your allowed domains during development.
