## Browser caching

Every logo request includes cache headers that tell browsers to store logos locally for 24 hours:

```http
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400
```

This happens automatically per user:

1. **First visit** - User's browser downloads logo from Logo.dev CDN
2. **Repeat visits** - Browser serves cached logo instantly (no API call)
3. **After 24 hours** - Browser fetches fresh logo if needed

Each user caches logos on their own device. This reduces API requests and provides instant load times without any configuration.

## Best practices

**Preload critical logos:**

```html
<link
  rel="preload"
  as="image"
  href="https://img.logo.dev/stripe.com?token=pk_xxx"
/>
```

**Lazy load below the fold:**

```html
<img
  src="https://img.logo.dev/stripe.com?token=pk_xxx"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Stripe logo"
/>
```

<Tip>
  Want to store logos on your own infrastructure? Pro and Enterprise plans
  include data caching licenses. See [self-hosting](/platform/self-hosting).
