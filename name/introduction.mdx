Have a list of company names but no domains? Our Name API lets you get the logos for companies by just their name.

<Note>
  The Name API is an easy to use wrapper of our Brand search and Logo APIs. Calling the name API is the same as searching for a company by name and then getting the logo of the first result.

  The Name API support all the same url parameters as the Logo API.
