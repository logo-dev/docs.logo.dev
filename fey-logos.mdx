### Overview

Fey Logos was a free, web-based library of high-quality vector (SVG) logos for public companies, created by Fey Labs Inc. to help designers find crisp, up-to-date brand marks for non-commercial use. Launched in early 2024 as an "open-source" resource, the service offered thousands of curated company logos through a searchable interface.

The library drew from Fey's internal database of over 4,000 company logos maintained for their investing app. In 2025, Fey Labs permanently shut down the service after widespread scraping and bulk downloads—despite terms prohibiting commercial use and automated access—made the project financially unsustainable.

### What it was

Fey Logos provided:

- **Vector-first library**: High-quality SVG logos for public companies
- **Designer-focused**: Built for personal, non-commercial mockups and design work
- **Searchable interface**: Easy discovery and download of brand-accurate logos
- **Actively maintained**: Regular updates with new logos and brand guideline compliance
- **Free access**: No API keys or authentication required

The service was closely connected to **Fey Labs Inc.**, the team behind the Fey investing app (later acquired by Wealthsimple). The logo library originated from Fey's internal need to maintain accurate, high-quality company marks for their product UI.

| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apr 11, 2023** | Fey adds 4,000+ high-quality logos to their internal database                      |
| **Jan 10, 2024** | Public launch: "We've decided to open-source our entire vector library. For free." |
| **2024**         | Community adoption grows via Reddit, X/Twitter, and design directories             |
| **2025**         | Service shut down due to scraping, bulk downloads, and unsustainable costs         |

### Why it shut down

Fey Labs posted an "Important update" explaining the shutdown:

- **Terms violations**: Users scraped the site and performed bulk downloads despite clear prohibitions
- **Commercial misuse**: Logos used commercially despite non-commercial-only terms
- **Cost escalation**: Bandwidth and hosting costs became unsustainable
- **Sustainability**: Unable to maintain free service under abuse conditions

This follows a common pattern for free asset libraries: well-intentioned projects become involuntary backends for commercial scrapers, driving costs beyond what volunteer or goodwill efforts can absorb.

### Service limitations

Even when operational, Fey Logos had constraints:

- **Non-commercial only** - Personal and editorial use; commercial use prohibited
- **No bulk access** - Individual download only; scraping/automation forbidden
- **Public companies focus** - Limited to publicly traded companies
- **Trademark limitations** - Logos remain trademarks of their owners
- **No API** - Web-only interface; no programmatic access
- **No guarantees** - Free service with no uptime or support commitments

### What replaced it

For production applications requiring reliable logo infrastructure, Logo.dev provides:

- **18M+ companies**: Comprehensive coverage beyond just public companies
- **Multiple formats**: PNG, SVG, WebP with size control
- **Production-ready**: Built for commercial use with guaranteed uptime
- **Programmatic access**: REST API with proper authentication and rate limits
- **Smart fallbacks**: Monogram generation for missing brands
- **Active maintenance**: Regular updates with zero overhead for developers
