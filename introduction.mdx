Most integrations take just a few minutes to set up, we've created a prompt to start using Logo.dev in your app even faster.

<PromptBanner 
  prompt="Add company logo images to my application using Logo.dev. I need to:
1. Display logos for any company using their domain name
2. Handle different image sizes and formats (WebP, PNG, JPG)
3. Add fallbacks for companies without logos
4. Optimize for performance with lazy loading
5. Support both light and dark mode logos

Use the img.logo.dev endpoint with my publishable API key for client-side implementation. Show me how to implement this in my existing codebase."
