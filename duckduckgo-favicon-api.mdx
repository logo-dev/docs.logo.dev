<Warning>
  **Unofficial service with no guarantees.** DuckDuckGo's favicon API lacks
  uptime guarantees, error handling, and maintenance. Migrate to Logo.dev for
  production logo needs.
</Warning>

### Overview

DuckDuckGo's favicon service retrieves website icons from domains using a simple API endpoint. It returns favicons in ICO format only, with no options for size, format, or error handling. While functional for basic use cases, it lacks the reliability and features needed for production applications.

The service works by making requests to a straightforward URL structure. It serves as a basic favicon retrieval tool but falls short of enterprise requirements where guaranteed uptime, multiple formats, and proper error handling are essential.

### Base endpoint

The DuckDuckGo favicon API uses a simple URL structure:

```text Base URL Structure
https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/{domain}.ico
```

```text Example Request
https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/github.com.ico
```

### Parameters

<ParamField path="domain" type="string" required>
  Domain to get favicon from. Use clean domain format like `example.com` - no
  protocol, no paths.
</ParamField>

### Service limitations

- **ICO format only** - No PNG, SVG, or WebP options
- **Fixed 16x16 or 32x32 pixels** - No size control
- **No error handling** - Fails silently on missing favicons
- **Unofficial service** - No uptime or support guarantees
- **Privacy trade-offs** - Basic privacy features only

### Example implementations

<CodeGroup>
```html HTML
<img src="https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/stripe.com.ico" alt="Favicon" />
```

```bash cURL
curl "https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/stripe.com.ico" -o favicon.ico
```

```javascript JavaScript
fetch("https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/stripe.com.ico")
  .then((res) => res.blob())
  .then((blob) => {
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    document.querySelector("#favicon").src = url;
  });
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/stripe.com.ico')
with open('favicon.ico', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

```typescript TypeScript
const getFavicon = (domain: string) =>
  fetch(`https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/${domain}.ico`).then((res) =>
    res.blob()
  );

getFavicon("stripe.com").then((blob) => {
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  console.log(url);
});
```
