<Warning>
  **Clearbit Logo API is shutting down December 1, 2025.** If your app uses
  `logo.clearbit.com`, it will stop working. Logo.dev is the official migration
  path recommended by Clearbit / HubSpot.
</Warning>

This guide will help you replace Clearbit's Logo API with Logo.dev for displaying company logos on your website or app. Most migrations only take a few minutes to change your **Base URL** and add a Logo.dev **Public Key** for authentication. Once you migrate, you can access the additional features Logo.dev provides such as new image parameters and alternate lookup methods.

## Why Logo.dev?

**We're the same team that originally built the Clearbit Logo API** and are the recommended migration partner by Clearbit / Hubspot.

Logo.dev serves tens of millions of logo images daily with a focus and dedication to quality. Our goal is to be the reliable platform that can be used by millions for free and has upgraded paid features to sustain the service for the long term so you never have to migrate to another service again.

Don't wait until your logos break when Clearbit is shut down. Migrate now and join the tens of thousands of developers using Logo.dev today.

## Migrate your website or app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update your Base URL">
  Logo.dev is a one-to-one replacement for the Clearbit Logo API so all your parameters will continue to work as you expect. After replacing the **Base URL**, your images will not be returned until you authenticate them.

    ```bash Clearbit Base URL
    https://logo.clearbit.com/
    ```

    ```bash Logo.dev Base URL
    https://img.logo.dev/
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an account and add your Public Key">
    To use Logo.dev, you'll need to [create an account](https://www.logo.dev/signup) and get your **Public Key** from the dashboard.

    ```bash Logo.dev Public Key
    LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

    For all integrations, it's as simple as adding the `token` parameter and passing your **Public Key**.

    ```bash Logo.dev Authenticated URL
    https://img.logo.dev/:domain?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY
    ```

Here's examples of how to add your authentication in different programming languages:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```html HTML
      <img src="https://img.logo.dev/stripe.com?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY" alt="Stripe logo" />
      ```

      ```jsx React
      function CompanyLogo({ domain }) {
        return (
          <img
            src={`https://img.logo.dev/${domain}?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY`}
            alt={`${domain} logo`}
          />
        );
      }
      ```

      ```tsx Next.js
      // Add img.logo.dev to your next.config.js:
      // module.exports = {
      //   images: {
      //     remotePatterns: [
      //       {
      //         protocol: 'https',
      //         hostname: 'img.logo.dev',
      //       },
      //     ],
      //   },
      // };

      import Image from 'next/image';

      function CompanyLogo({ domain }: { domain: string }) {
        return (
          <Image
            src={`https://img.logo.dev/${domain}?token=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGO_DEV_KEY}`}
            alt={`${domain} logo`}
            width={128}
            height={128}
          />
        );
      }
      ```

      ```vue Vue
      <template>
        <img
          :src="`https://img.logo.dev/${domain}?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY`"
          :alt="`${domain} logo`"
        />
      </template>

      <script>
      export default {
        props: ['domain']
      }
      </script>
      ```

      ```python Python
      import requests

      def get_company_logo(domain):
          url = f"https://img.logo.dev/{domain}?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY"
          response = requests.get(url)
          return response.content
      ```

      ```ruby Ruby
      require 'net/http'

      def get_company_logo(domain)
        uri = URI("https://img.logo.dev/#{domain}?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY")
        Net::HTTP.get(uri)
      end
      ```

      ```php PHP
      function getCompanyLogo($domain) {
          $url = "https://img.logo.dev/{$domain}?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY";
          return file_get_contents($url);
      }
      ```

      ```kotlin Android (Kotlin)
      import com.squareup.picasso.Picasso

      fun loadCompanyLogo(domain: String, imageView: ImageView) {
          val url = "https://img.logo.dev/$domain?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY"
          Picasso.get()
              .load(url)
              .placeholder(R.drawable.logo_placeholder)
              .into(imageView)
      }

      // Using Coil (modern Android image loading)
      imageView.load("https://img.logo.dev/$domain?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY") {
          placeholder(R.drawable.logo_placeholder)
          error(R.drawable.logo_error)
      }
      ```

      ```swift Swift (iOS)
      import SwiftUI

      struct CompanyLogo: View {
          let domain: String

          var body: some View {
              AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://img.logo.dev/\(domain)?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY")) { image in
                  image
                      .resizable()
                      .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
              } placeholder: {
                  ProgressView()
              }
              .frame(width: 128, height: 128)
          }
      }

      // Using URLSession for direct download
      func downloadCompanyLogo(domain: String) async throws -> Data {
          let url = URL(string: "https://img.logo.dev/\(domain)?token=LOGO_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY")!
          let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
          return data
      }

  <Step title="Update your Attribution Link">
  Free tier requires attribution back to Logo.dev wherever you display logos. Skip attribution by [upgrading to any paid plan](https://www.logo.dev/pricing) starting at $300/year.

```html Logo.dev Attribution Link
<a href="https://logo.dev" title="Logo API">Logos provided by Logo.dev</a>
```

Attribution links must be:

- On a production site.
- Publicly accessible
- Be followable by search engines.

Learn more about how to [add your attribution link](/platform/attribution).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and deploy">
  Before deploying to production, test that logos are displaying correctly:

- Verify logos match expected companies
- Check image quality and resolution
- There's no remaining references to `logo.clearbit.com`

Any low-quality or incorrect logos can be fixed within 24 hours by [reporting them here](https://www.logo.dev/update). Our team actively maintains the logo database with daily updates.
