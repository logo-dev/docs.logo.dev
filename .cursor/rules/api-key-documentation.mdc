# API Key Documentation Standards

## Key Types and Naming

- **Publishable keys**: Public keys that begin with "live\_", only for img.logo.dev endpoint
- **Secret keys**: Start with "sk\_", used for all other API endpoints
- Always clarify scope and security implications inline

## Documentation Pattern

1. Lead with key types and explain immediately
2. Be specific about scope (e.g., "accessing our image CDN" not just "logo images")
3. Include security implications directly in descriptions
4. Show keys in context once - avoid repetitive examples
5. Dashboard-first approach for key management

## Example Structure

```mdx
<Note>
  To view and manage your API keys, visit the [Logo.dev
  dashboard](mdc:https:/dashboard.logo.dev).
</Note>

Logo.dev uses two types of API keys:

**Publishable keys** (pk_xxxxxxxxxxx) - Public keys for accessing our image CDN at img.logo.dev. Safe to expose in client-side code.

**Secret keys** (sk_xxxxxxxxxxx) - Private keys for all other API endpoints. Keep these secure and never expose in client-side code.
```

## Security Best Practices

- Embed security warnings directly in key type descriptions
- Don't create separate "Security" sections unless absolutely necessary
- Link to dashboard for key rotation and management
- Keep examples minimal and contextual
