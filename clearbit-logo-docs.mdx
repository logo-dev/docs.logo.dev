<Warning>
  **Clearbit Logo API is shutting down.** If your app uses `logo.clearbit.com`,
  it will stop working. Logo.dev is the official migration path recommended by
  Clearbit/HubSpot.
</Warning>

### Overview

The Clearbit Logo API served millions of logo requests daily for nearly a decade as the industry standard for company logo retrieval. Launched in 2015, it introduced the simple domain-to-logo approach that became essential for developers adding visual branding to applications.

This documentation explains how Clearbit Logo API worked and guides migration to Logo.dev. Our team created the original Clearbit Logo API, and following Clearbit's HubSpot acquisition, we developed Logo.dev as its official successor. Logo.dev maintains the same simplicity while adding stock ticker lookup, cryptocurrency symbols, and enhanced image formats.

### Base endpoint

The Clearbit Logo API used a simple URL structure:

```text Base URL Structure
https://logo.clearbit.com/{domain}
```

```text Example Request
https://logo.clearbit.com/google.com
```

### Parameters

<ParamField path="domain" type="string" required>
  Company domain placed in the path, immediately after the host.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="size" type="number" default="128">
  Desired width in pixels. Height auto-scales to preserve aspect ratio.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="format" type="string" default="png">
  Output format. Common values: `png`, `jpg`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="greyscale" type="boolean" default="false">
  Returns a greyscale version of the logo when set to `true`.
</ParamField>

### Example implementations

fetch(`https://logo.clearbit.com/${domain}?size=${size}`)
  .then((res) => {
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Logo not found");
    return res.blob();
  })
  .then((blob) => {
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    document.querySelector("#logo").src = url;
  });
