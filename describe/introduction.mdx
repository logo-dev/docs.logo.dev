Need to go from domain to brand name? Our Describe API allows you to access all the brand data we have for a given domain.

<Note>
  The Describe API is available on any paid plan. Head to https://www.logo.dev/pricing to get started.

Reach out to us at [support@logo.dev](mailto:support@logo.dev?subject=Describe%20API) if you see any gaps in coverage.

</Note>

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer: YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "http://api.logo.dev/describe/domain"
```

All you need to provide is a query and your secret key, which can be found on the [dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard) and is formatted like `sk_...`.

## In example, looking up “sweetgreen”

Using `curl` to test this from the command line, but obviously call the API anywhere that supports headers.

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer: YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "http://api.logo.dev/describe/sweetgreen.com"
```

### Results

Expect a single object in the following format. The socials object will return a key-value pair if a social link is detected.

```json
{
  "name": "sweetgreen",
  "domain": "sweetgreen.com",
  "description": "Simple, seasonal, healthy salads and grain bowls made in-house from scratch, using whole produce delivered that morning.",
  "indexed_at": "2025-03-10T11:36:23.885238001Z",
  "socials": {
    "facebook": "http://facebook.com/sweetgreen",
    "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/sweetgreen/",
    "twitter": "https://x.com/sweetgreen"
  },
  "logo": "https://img.logo.dev/sweetgreen.com?token=live_6a1a28fd-6420-4492-aeb0-b297461d9de2",

### Keep your secret a secret, keep it safe

Unlike the public key, it’s your responsibility to keep your secret key safe and away from public eyes. Even during testing, please never publish to Github or allow it to be seen from front-end code.

If you’re secret key is ever leaked, please get in touch immediately so we can regenerate a new one for you.
