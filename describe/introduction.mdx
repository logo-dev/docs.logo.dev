Need to go from domain to brand name? Our Describe API allows you to access all the brand data we have for a given domain.

<Note>
  The Describe API is available on any paid plan. Head to https://www.logo.dev/pricing to get started.

Reach out to us at [support@logo.dev](mailto:support@logo.dev?subject=Describe%20API) if you see any gaps in coverage.

</Note>

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "http://api.logo.dev/describe/domain"
```

All you need to provide is a query and your secret key, which can be found on the [dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard) and is formatted like `sk_...`.

## In example, looking up “sweetgreen”

Using `curl` to test this from the command line, but obviously call the API anywhere that supports headers.

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "http://api.logo.dev/describe/sweetgreen.com"
```

### Results

Expect a single object in the following format. The socials object will return a key-value pair if a social link is detected.

```json
{
  "name": "sweetgreen",
  "domain": "sweetgreen.com",
  "description": "Simple, seasonal, healthy salads and grain bowls made in-house from scratch, using whole produce delivered that morning.",
  "indexed_at": "2025-03-10T11:36:23.885238001Z",
  "socials": {
    "facebook": "http://facebook.com/sweetgreen",
    "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/sweetgreen/",
    "twitter": "https://x.com/sweetgreen"
  },
  "logo": "https://img.logo.dev/sweetgreen.com?token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
  "blurhash": "UJPanPxr?Vj[oxazj@od_FWDDoodxrodagWD",
  "colors": [
    { "r": 228, "g": 255, "b": 85, "hex": "#e4ff55" },
    { "r": 10, "g": 75, "b": 43, "hex": "#0a4b2b" },
    { "r": 125, "g": 173, "b": 80, "hex": "#7dad50" }
  ]
}
```

`blurhash` is the [blurhash](https://blurha.sh/) for the logo of the requested domain. A blurhash is a compact string representation that encodes a placeholder image, allowing you to show a blurred preview while the actual logo loads.

`colors` is an array of prominent colors for the logo. They are roughly ordered by prominence in the image.

The currently supported social sites are:

- facebook
- github
- instagram
- linkedin
- pinterest
- reddit
- snapchat
- telegram
- tumblr
- twitter (aka X)
- wechat
- whatsapp
- youtube

## Using Blurhash

The `blurhash` field provides a compact string that encodes a blurred placeholder of the logo. Blurhash improves perceived performance by displaying an instant preview while the actual logo loads—no layout shifts, no blank spaces, just smooth transitions. The entire placeholder is encoded in ~20-30 characters.

For implementation details and code examples, see the [official blurhash documentation](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash) with decoders available for TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin, and more.

### Keep your secret a secret, keep it safe

Unlike the public key, it’s your responsibility to keep your secret key safe and away from public eyes. Even during testing, please never publish to Github or allow it to be seen from front-end code.

If you’re secret key is ever leaked, please get in touch immediately so we can regenerate a new one for you.
