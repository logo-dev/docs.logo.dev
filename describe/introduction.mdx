Need to go from domain to brand name? Our Describe API allows you to access all the brand data we have for a given domain.

<Warning>
The Describe API is available as a closed alpha. It is still in active development and we are seeking feedback on its performance.

Reach out to us at [team@logo.dev](mailto:team@logo.dev?subject=Brand%20Search) if you want access to this endpoint.

</Warning>

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer: YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "http://api.logo.dev/describe/domain"
```

All you need to provide is a query and your secret key, which can be found on the [dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard) and is formatted like `sk_...`.

## In example, looking up “sweetgreen”

Using `curl` to test this from the command line, but obviously call the API anywhere that supports headers.

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer: YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "http://api.logo.dev/describe/sweetgreen.com"
```

### Keep your secret a secret, keep it safe

Unlike the public key, it’s your responsibility to keep your secret key safe and away from public eyes. Even during testing, please never publish to Github or allow it to be seen from front-end code.

If you’re secret key is ever leaked, please get in touch immediately so we can regenerate a new one for you.
