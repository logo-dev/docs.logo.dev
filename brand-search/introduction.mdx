title: "Brand API Search - Find Company Logos by Name"
description: "Brand API to search company logos by name. Find company domains, get brand logos with autocomplete. Logo API with public key auth. Free beta access."
---

Need to go from a brand name to a domain? Our Brand Search API is the easiest way to get autocomplete results or grab the most popular domain for a brand.

<Warning>

Brand search is available as a public beta. We are still actively changing the search and ranking capabilities. During testing all access to the API is free with no restrictions.

Please provide feedback to [support@logo.dev](mailto:support@logo.dev?subject=Brand%20Search) with any questions or concerns.

</Warning>

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "https://api.logo.dev/search?q=QUERY"
```

All you need to provide is a query and your secret key, which can be found on the [dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard) and is formatted like `sk_...`.

## In example, looking up “sweetgreen”

Using `curl` to test this from the command line, but obviously call the API anywhere that supports headers.

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "https://api.logo.dev/search?q=sweetgreen"
```

### Results

Expect an array of objects in the following format. Currently, there is a max of 10 results returned that are sorted by general popularity metrics.

```json
[
	{
		"name":"sweetgreen"
		"domain":"sweetgreen.com"
	},
	{
		"name":"Sweet Greens Healthy Restaurant"
		"domain":"sweetgreens.ae"
	},
	{
		"name":"Sweet Green Hotel",
		"domain":"sweetgreenhotel.com"
		},
	{
		"name":"Sweet Green Apothecary",
		"domain":"sweetgreenapothecary.com"
	}
]
```

### Keep your secret a secret, keep it safe

Unlike the public key, it’s your responsibility to keep your secret key safe and away from public eyes. Even during testing, please never publish to Github or allow it to be seen from front-end code.

If you’re secret key is ever leaked, please get in touch immediately so we can regenerate a new one for you.
