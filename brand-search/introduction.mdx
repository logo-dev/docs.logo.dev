Need to go from a brand name to a domain? Brand Search API finds company domains with autocomplete support and flexible matching strategies.

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "https://api.logo.dev/search?q=QUERY"
```

All you need to provide is a query and your secret key, which can be found on the [dashboard](https://www.logo.dev/dashboard) and is formatted like `sk_...`.

## In example, looking up “sweetgreen”

Using `curl` to test this from the command line, but obviously call the API anywhere that supports headers.

```bash
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" "https://api.logo.dev/search?q=sweetgreen"
```

### Results

Expect an array of objects in the following format. Currently, there is a max of 10 results returned that are sorted by general popularity metrics.

```json
[
	{
		"name":"sweetgreen"
		"domain":"sweetgreen.com"
	},
	{
		"name":"Sweet Greens Healthy Restaurant"
		"domain":"sweetgreens.ae"
	},
	{
		"name":"Sweet Green Hotel",
		"domain":"sweetgreenhotel.com"
		},
	{
		"name":"Sweet Green Apothecary",
		"domain":"sweetgreenapothecary.com"
	}
]
```

## Search strategies

By default, Brand Search uses `typeahead`, which favors popular prefix matches for autocomplete.

You can switch to exact matching with the optional `strategy` parameter:

- `typeahead` (default): Best for autosuggest and exploratory typing.
- `match`: Best when you want exact/near-exact name matches to rank first.

### Parameters

- `q` (required): The brand name query.
- `strategy` (optional): `typeahead` | `match` (default: `typeahead`).

### Examples

```bash
# Default typeahead (prefix-forward)
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" \
  "https://api.logo.dev/search?q=fa"

# Prefer exact matches
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" \
  "https://api.logo.dev/search?q=fa&strategy=match"
```

<Tip>
Use `strategy=match` when you have near-complete names and need exactness; keep `typeahead` for live search UX.

### Keep your secret a secret, keep it safe

Unlike the public key, it’s your responsibility to keep your secret key safe and away from public eyes. Even during testing, please never publish to Github or allow it to be seen from front-end code.

If you’re secret key is ever leaked, please get in touch immediately so we can regenerate a new one for you.
