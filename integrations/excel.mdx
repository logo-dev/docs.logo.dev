Add company logos to Excel spreadsheets using Logo.dev's API. Automatically populate customer lists, vendor databases, and reports with up-to-date company logos. Works with Excel for Microsoft 365, Excel 2019, and Excel Online.

<Note>
  Get your API key from the [Logo.dev dashboard](https://dashboard.logo.dev) to
  get started.
</Note>

## Basic formula

Use Excel's `IMAGE` function to display logos from company domains:

<CodeGroup>

```excel Basic formula
=IMAGE("https://img.logo.dev/microsoft.com?token=YOUR_API_KEY")
```

```excel With cell reference
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png"))
```

```excel Advanced with parameters
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png&size=128&greyscale=true"))
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your publishable key from the dashboard.

The basic formula uses a hardcoded domain, while the cell reference formula pulls the domain from cell A2 dynamically.

## Insert logos from web URL

For Excel versions without the IMAGE function, insert logos directly from the web:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Insert Pictures dialog">
    Click **Insert** > **Pictures** > **Online Pictures** (or **From Web** in
    newer versions)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste Logo.dev URL">
    Paste the Logo.dev URL with your API key: ```
    https://img.logo.dev/stripe.com?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png&size=256 ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert the logo">
    Press Enter to insert the logo into your spreadsheet
  </Step>
</Steps>

This method works in all Excel versions including Excel 2013 and 2016.

## Add logos to Excel headers and footers

Add your company logo to headers or footers for branded reports:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Header & Footer view">
    Go to **Insert** > **Header & Footer**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select header section">
    Click the header section where you want the logo (left, center, or right)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert picture from web">
    In the **Header & Footer Tools Design** tab, click **Picture** > **Online
    Pictures**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Logo.dev URL">
    Paste your Logo.dev URL:
    {""}
    ```
    https://img.logo.dev/yourcompany.com?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png&size=128
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize logo appearance

Customize logo size, format, and effects using URL parameters:

<CodeGroup>

```excel PNG logo with size
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png&size=256"))
```

```excel Greyscale logo
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&greyscale=true"))
```

```excel Dark mode optimized
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&theme=dark"))
```

```excel Combined parameters
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png&size=128&greyscale=true"))
```

</CodeGroup>

## Excel version compatibility

| Excel Version | IMAGE Function Support         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Microsoft 365 | ✓ Full support                 |
| Excel 2019    | ✓ Full support                 |
| Excel Online  | ✓ Full support                 |
| Excel 2016    | ✗ Use VBA or insert as picture |
| Excel 2013    | ✗ Use VBA or insert as picture |

For older Excel versions, insert logos as pictures using the web URL method.

## Position and lock logos with cells

Keep logos aligned with your data as you sort, filter, and resize:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the logo">
    Right-click the logo image in your spreadsheet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open properties">
    Select **Size & Properties** (or **Format Picture**)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose positioning behavior">
    Under the **Properties** tab, choose your preferred option: - **Move and
    size with cells** - Logo resizes when cell dimensions change - **Move but
    don't size with cells** - Logo maintains size but moves with the cell -
    **Don't move or size with cells** - Logo stays fixed in position
  </Step>
</Steps>

This ensures logos stay with their corresponding rows when sorting or filtering data.

## VBA macro for bulk logos

For advanced users, use this VBA macro to add logos to multiple cells:

```vba
Sub AddLogos()
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim apiKey As String

    apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"

    For Each cell In Selection
        If cell.Value <> "" Then
            cell.Offset(0, 1).Formula = "=IMAGE(""https://img.logo.dev/" & _
                cell.Value & "?token=" & apiKey & "&format=png"")"
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
```

Select cells with domains and run the macro to populate adjacent cells with logos.
