Display company logos in Google Sheets using Logo.dev's API. Automatically enrich spreadsheets with logos for CRM data, company lists, competitor analysis, and investor tracking. Works instantly with the IMAGE formulaâ€”no apps or extensions required.

<Note>
  Get your API key from the [Logo.dev dashboard](https://dashboard.logo.dev) to
  get started.
</Note>

## Basic formula

Use Google Sheets' `IMAGE` function to display logos from company domains:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Basic formula
=IMAGE("https://img.logo.dev/apple.com?token=YOUR_API_KEY")
```

```javascript With cell reference
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png"))
```

```javascript With custom sizing
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&size=256"), 4, 64, 64)
```

```javascript ARRAYFORMULA for bulk
=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A2:A="",,IMAGE("https://img.logo.dev/"&A2:A&"?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png&size=128")))
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your publishable key from the dashboard.

The basic formula uses a hardcoded domain, while the cell reference formula pulls domains from cells dynamically. Use ARRAYFORMULA to apply logos to entire columns at once.

## Customize logo appearance

Customize logo appearance with URL parameters:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript PNG with size
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png&size=256"))
```

```javascript Greyscale
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&greyscale=true"))
```

```javascript Dark mode optimized
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&theme=dark"))
```

```javascript Combined parameters
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png&size=256&greyscale=true"))
```

</CodeGroup>

## Control image sizing in cells

Google Sheets' IMAGE function supports sizing modes:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Mode 1: Resize to fit cell
=IMAGE("https://img.logo.dev/google.com?token=YOUR_API_KEY", 1)
```

```javascript Mode 2: Stretch to fit cell
=IMAGE("https://img.logo.dev/google.com?token=YOUR_API_KEY", 2)
```

```javascript Mode 3: Original size
=IMAGE("https://img.logo.dev/google.com?token=YOUR_API_KEY", 3)
```

```javascript Mode 4: Custom size (100x100)
=IMAGE("https://img.logo.dev/google.com?token=YOUR_API_KEY", 4, 100, 100)
```

```javascript High quality custom size
=IMAGE(CONCAT("https://img.logo.dev/", A2, "?token=YOUR_API_KEY&size=256"), 4, 64, 64)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Bulk logo retrieval with ARRAYFORMULA

Apply the logo formula to entire columns using ARRAYFORMULA:

```
=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A2:A="",,IMAGE("https://img.logo.dev/"&A2:A&"?token=YOUR_API_KEY&format=png&size=128")))
```

This formula:

- Checks if cells in column A are empty
- If not empty, generates a logo from the domain
- Applies to all rows automatically as you add data

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Does this work in Google Sheets mobile app?">
  Yes. The IMAGE function and Logo.dev API work in Google Sheets on mobile (iOS and Android). Logos will load automatically when you have an internet connection.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can I use this in Google Apps Script?">
  Yes. You can fetch logos programmatically using Google Apps Script with
  UrlFetchApp to call the Logo.dev API, then insert images into your sheet.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do I add logos to multiple rows at once?">
  Use ARRAYFORMULA with the IMAGE function to apply logos to entire columns. See
  the "Bulk logo retrieval" section above for the formula.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Will logos appear when I share the Google Sheet?">
  Yes. Anyone who opens the shared Google Sheet will see the logos, even if they
  don't have a Logo.dev account. The API key in the formula handles
  authentication.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can I use this in Google Docs or Google Slides?">
  No. The IMAGE function is specific to Google Sheets. For Google Docs or
  Slides, you'll need to download logos first using the Logo.dev URL, then
  insert them manually.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do I handle companies without logos?">
  Logo.dev returns generated monograms for companies without logos. To check if
  a real logo exists, use the Brand Search API to verify coverage before
  inserting.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What image format should I use for Google Sheets?">
  PNG format is recommended for best quality and compatibility. Google Sheets
  handles PNG well. Use `format=png` in your Logo.dev URL.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can I filter or sort rows with logo images?">
  Yes. Google Sheets treats images in cells normally, so you can filter and sort
  rows that contain logos. Use "Move and size with cells" if inserting images as
  overlays.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do I look up logos if I only have company names?">
  Use Logo.dev's [Brand Search API](/brand-search/introduction) with the company
  name as a query parameter. This returns logos based on company name matching
  instead of domains.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Are there rate limits for Google Sheets integrations?">
  Yes. Each plan has defined usage limits. Free accounts include 1,000 requests
  per month. Google Sheets may cache images, reducing repeated API calls. See
  [pricing](https://www.logo.dev/pricing) for higher limits.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can I use dark mode optimized logos?">
  Yes. Add `theme=dark` to your Logo.dev URL to get logos optimized for dark
  backgrounds. This is useful if your sheet has a dark theme.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do I make logos clickable?">
  Google Sheets doesn't support clickable images directly. However, you can add
  a separate column with HYPERLINK formulas pointing to company websites.
